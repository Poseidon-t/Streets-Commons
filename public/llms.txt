# SafeStreets by Streets & Commons

> Free satellite-powered walkability analysis for any address worldwide. Score streets on 8 metrics using NASA, Sentinel-2, and OpenStreetMap data.

## What SafeStreets Does

SafeStreets analyzes the walkability of any address worldwide using real satellite and open data sources. Users enter an address and receive scores across 8 walkability metrics:

1. **Sidewalk Coverage** — Percentage of streets with sidewalks within 400m (OpenStreetMap)
2. **Tree Canopy** — Vegetation and shade coverage via Sentinel-2 NDVI satellite imagery
3. **Pedestrian Crossings** — Crossing density and safety infrastructure (OpenStreetMap)
4. **Street Lighting** — Lit street coverage for nighttime safety (OpenStreetMap)
5. **Terrain Slope** — ADA accessibility via NASADEM elevation data
6. **Air Quality** — Real-time PM2.5 and pollution monitoring (OpenAQ)
7. **Traffic Safety** — Fatal crash data within 800m (NHTSA FARS for US, WHO for international)
8. **15-Minute City** — Whether daily services (grocery, schools, parks, transit) are within a 15-min walk

## Key Features

- **Free core analysis**: All 8 walkability metrics, composite score, grade, equity insights, 15-minute city analysis, street cross-section, and compare mode — no sign-up required
- **Advocacy Toolkit** ($19 one-time): Street audit tool, AI advocacy documents, street redesign mockups, unlimited AI chatbot, PDF/JSON export, save up to 10 addresses
- **Global coverage**: Works in 190+ countries using satellite data
- **City pages**: Pre-built walkability guides for 20+ major US cities
